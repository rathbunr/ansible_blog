# About

## Who I Am

I'm an Cyber Security Architect specializing in enterprise automation, currently managing 
around thousands of systems across Windows and RHEL environments. My background spans identity 
management, security, directory services, and cloud infrastructure.

## My Approach

I believe in **systematic fault analysis** - breaking down complex problems layer by layer 
rather than trial-and-error troubleshooting. This methodology comes from my earlier career 
teaching fault analysis in HVAC and electrical engineering, and it translates remarkably 
well to IT infrastructure.

## What I Work With

- **Ansible Automation Platform** - Containerized deployments, execution environments, 
  LDAP integration
- **Red Hat Satellite** - Systems management, patching, provisioning
- **Red Hat Image Builder** - CIS-compliant RHEL images, STIG hardening
- **Windows Server** - Active Directory, Group Policy, hybrid environments
- **Security & Compliance** - CMMC Level 2, OpenSCAP, Nessus

## Why This Blog

This site serves as my technical notebook - a place to document solutions to problems 
I've solved, patterns I've discovered, and lessons learned the hard way. If it helps 
someone else avoid the same pitfalls, even better.
